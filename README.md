# Single-cell-RNA-sequencing
Objectives are to:   Optimise the scRNA-seq data approach using Seurat by investigating the effects of QC and  background correction for healthy and a diabetic dataset of the mouse retina.  Perform differential gene expression.   Perform clustering of the different retinal cell types from the scRNA-Seq data by assessing a  range of publicly available algorithms.  Identify the cell-types for both control and diabetic retinal dataset.  Try to install different deconvolution packages that suits the project.  Use them to identify cell-type proportions from bulk data guided by the scRNAseq data   Compare the results to identify the best proportions and the most affected cell-types.
